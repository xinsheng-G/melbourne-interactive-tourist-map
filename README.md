Note on setting up a local server for running the project:
Our project could be opened by following the announcement sent by Dr Alan Thomas on Oct 16, 2021.
However, If using Windows:
When using command prompt, try "python -m http.server"(this command might not work properly for CMD and some of our features cannot be displayed) or "py -3 -m http.server".
Or open PowerShell, try ”python -m http.server”.
